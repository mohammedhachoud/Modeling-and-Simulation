## Lab 1: Introduction and General Concepts
This lab introduces the basic concepts of **Modeling and Simulation** and the importance of these techniques in various fields. We explore different types of simulation methods and how models represent real-world systems.

## Notebook 2: Introduction to Programming with Python 3 for Scientific Computing
In this notebook, we cover the basics of **Python 3 programming** for scientific applications, introducing libraries such as **NumPy**, **SciPy**, and **Matplotlib** to perform computations, data analysis, and visualize results.

## Notebook 3: Probabilities and Random Number Simulation
We explore concepts of **probability theory** and demonstrate how to use Python to simulate **random number generation** for various distributions, such as uniform, normal, and Poisson distributions.

## Notebook 4: Modeling Dynamical Systems
In this notebook, we model **dynamical systems** using **differential equations**. We simulate the behavior of systems that evolve over time, such as population growth models and mechanical systems.

## Notebook 5: Solving Problems with Monte-Carlo Simulation Technique
Here, we introduce the **Monte-Carlo simulation** technique to solve problems involving randomness and uncertainty. We demonstrate how to apply Monte-Carlo methods to estimate integrals, optimize functions, and solve probabilistic problems.

## Notebook 6: Stochastic Processes and Markov-Chain
We explore **stochastic processes** and their applications, focusing on **Markov chains** to model systems where the future state depends only on the present state. Examples include queueing systems, financial markets, and biological processes.

## Notebook 7: Modeling and Simulating Discrete-Event Systems
This notebook focuses on **discrete-event systems**, where events occur at specific points in time. We simulate processes such as manufacturing systems, telecommunications, and traffic systems using event-driven models.
